# Event-Recommendation-System
Building a Event Recommendation Engine using a dataset made by VIT students themselves
We will be using an original dataset made by the students of VIT. This dataset contains 18000 ratings across 2000 events for 119 users.

We are going to build a recommendation engine which will suggest events for a user which he hasn't attended yet based on the events which he has already rated. We will be using k-nearest neighbour algorithm which we will implement from scratch.
